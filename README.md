# Generative-Adversarial-Training

This is the repository of Thomas Fiello's and Justus Renkhoff's class project for CS595A at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Spring 2023).

## Getting Started

First, we recommend to create an environment to install the appropriate Python packages. For this we recommend to use conda (https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html). 

After installing Anaconda on your system (https://www.anaconda.com/download/), use the following command to create a conda environment. 

```console
conda create --name <env_name>
``` 

This environment can then be activated using the command:

```console
conda activate <env_name>
```
