# Generative-Adversarial-Training

This is the repository of Thomas Fiello's and Justus Renkhoff's class project for CS595A at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Spring 2023).

## Getting Started

### Setting up environment
First, we recommend to create an environment to install the appropriate Python packages. For this we recommend to use conda (https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html). 

After installing Anaconda on your system (https://www.anaconda.com/download/), you can create a conda environment. Inside the repository is a environment.yml file which contains all necessary packages to execute the code. The environment including the packages can be created and installed by executing the following command: 
```console
conda env create -f environment.yml
``` 

The name of created environment <env_name> should be env_gen_ai_cs595. This environment can then be activated using the following command. 
```console
conda activate <env_name>
``` 

Depending on the IDE used, further steps may be required to add the environment as a kernel. n Jupyter it might be needed to add your environment to Jupyter with:
```console
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env_name>
```
